 ### TODO:
# 1. gradio interface to upload image
# 2. use image ai model to determine if feather is from protected-birds.csv file
# 3. prompt user to verify results if bird is protected for themselves before making a report
# 4. list possible protected birds from list of protected-birds.csv file along with confidence score
# 5. output the result in a table format along with search queries for each bird for user to verify
# 6. prompt user to make a report they are confident the feather in the image is from a protected bird along with the link to https://www.fws.gov/contact-us
